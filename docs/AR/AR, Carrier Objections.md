AR, Carrier Objections

_Last Updated: 12/06/2024_

# Basics

**What is this about?**

Insurance carriers will send objections to invoices. Carriers object for multiple reasons. When objections are received, Billing/Legal will perform necessary research to locate orders the objection pertains to, attach and note objections, and determine whether or not the objection falls within Labor Code timelines.

**Who is involved?**

- Billing Specialists

**Why should we do it?**

Properly logging and attaching carrier objections ensures the collector working the case can proceed with collection attempts to get the invoice paid.

   - Invoice/DaisyBill number\

**Refund Request**

Email to AR Supervisor.

**Incorrect Carrier**

When the carrier specifically states that they are not the carrier, attach as a normal objection with the SBR needed label or New Corr label. Then, add Incorrect Carrier Label with a **15-day follow-up**. 

**Voucher Invoices**

- Apply the **New Correspondence** and **Voucher** labels. Voucher invoices do not follow regular invoice timelines.  

- If there is no follow-up date (FUD) set, after uploading the objection, change the follow-up date to **30 days** from when we received the objection. If a follow-up date is already assigned, **do not change** the follow-up date.


## Apply/Remove Labels and Follow-Up Dates 

Once the objection(s) is uploaded, you will need to apply the correct labels and/or follow-up date to the invoice(s) in order for the correct specialist to follow up on the invoice. 


### Type of Labels and Follow-Up Dates

The following labels and follow-up dates will be applied dependent on the information given on the objection. 


#### Needs SBR

Apply when the objection is received **within the first 12 months** of the initial invoice or a new carrier being verified.\
_This does not include Legacy invoices, as they are beyond the timelines and a new carrier will not qualify the invoice for a new timeline._

This includes any invoice within the fee schedule.

- Add sets

- Original order


#### Non-compliant EOR

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdHIIgbMYI1psS2NQUZL3oWM4UlITDHm8Wq73uIUNfDuKMrINPjv8qyPkbbq_AXXpGL4f_pJS7JVmdCalGldUgSfMRsD816Qr-YdYSO1WsZUBD_4SXZLDqETX1ZVvLmIxTYqGfuOQ?key=9RqFFpIFA_AOpLPwT8MOLA)

Apply when the objection is outside the 60-day timeline the carrier has to send an objection and it is still **within the first 12 months** of the initial invoice or a new carrier being verified.\
_This does not include Legacy invoices, as they are beyond the timelines and a new carrier will not qualify the invoice for a new timeline._

\


Set a follow-up date **45 days** out from the date received (or closest workday). _The date an invoice is received can be determined by the folder where you received the objection._

**Exceptions**

- If first correspondence is received after the 60 days, then the invoice is no longer qualified for a second bill review. Add the “New Correspondence” label and set the follow up date to **30 days**.

- If the EOR’s objection is that they are not the correct carrier, then apply the Incorrect Carrier label and set the **follow-up date for 15 days.**

- If the invoice has the Personal Appearance (PA) Label, the invoice is no longer qualified for a second bill review. Add the “New Correspondence” label and set the follow up date to 30 days.

- If the invoice has the MTQ label, the invoice is no longer qualified for a second bill review. Add the “New Correspondence” label and set the follow up date for 30 days. If the objection specifies an invoice, the invoice can be submitted for write off. Then, reach out to one of the AR supervisors.\

#### Partial Payment SBR

This will need to be applied to any invoices that are within the SBR timeframe but has received a partial payment. The follow up date still follows the normal SBR FUD.


#### DB SBR Needed

Apply when a Daisy Denial EOR is received within 90 days of the initial invoice or a new carrier being verified.\
_This does not include Legacy invoices, as they are beyond the timelines and a new carrier will not qualify the invoice for a new timeline._

Set a follow-up date **45 days** out from the date received (or closest workday). _The date a Daisy Denial EOR is received can be determined by the_ **_Effective Date_** _on the bill’s main page._


#### Incorrect Carrier

Apply as an additional label to the correct timeline label (SBR needed or New Correspondence) when the objection is claiming they are the incorrect carrier. 

Set a new follow-up date for 15 days.


#### Needs Independent Bill Review (IBR)

Apply when the SBR is denied due to any issue with money. I.E. partial payments.

Set the follow-up date to tomorrow and let the lgl/billing supervisor know.


#### Final Determination

Apply when the carrier is denying the SBR for reasons other than the dollar amount 


#### New Correspondence

- Apply when any objection comes in after given timelines (60-day initial time frame), including invoices that were previously in DAS (second sets, etc.)

- If the Invoice is within the **SBR timeframe** and already has an objection and the SBR label

- Apply always for Voucher Invoices

- Set the follow-up date **30 days** out if one is not already on the invoice. 


#### Payment Allowed

Use code 4 (fee adjusted to fee schedule).

Apply as an additional label when an EOR comes in allowing payment (Still need to have New Corr or SBR Needed label)


#### Voucher

Apply the Voucher Objection label.

**30 Days follow-up** if there is no follow-up date already


#### AR New Timeline

Check to see when the “AR New Timeline” label was added and treat it as if it was the “Date of Service.” 

If the objection was received within 60 days from when the label was added, follow the “SBR Needed” process.
