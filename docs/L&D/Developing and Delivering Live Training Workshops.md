# Analysis 

## Identifying Training Needs 

- Conduct a thorough assessment of the organization's current performance, employee skills, and knowledge gaps.

    - GEMBA Walks

    - Focus Groups

    - Analyzing QA results

- Gather input from various stakeholders, including managers, employees, and subject matter experts.

- Use surveys, interviews, performance reviews, investigations, and other methods to identify specific areas where training is needed. 


## Define Learning Objectives

- Based on the identified training needs, establish clear and measurable learning objectives.

- Ensure that learning objectives are aligned with organizational goals and priorities.

- Use the SMART criteria (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) to craft objectives that guide the development of the training content.

    - Example: By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to accurately complete X task with 90% accuracy.


# Design

## Content Design and Instructional Strategy Selection

- Design the content of the training program based on the defined learning objectives. [Facilitators Guide - EXAMPLE TEMPLATE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15KB-2w6iZy9Ds1ud6c3DZhu3oCjqsIGl8cyiEDsDYdg/edit)

- Select appropriate instructional strategies, methods, and media to engage learners and facilitate effective learning.

- Organize the content into modules or sections that flow logically and support the achievement of learning objectives.

Design Activities, Exercises, and Supporting Materials

- Develop interactive activities, exercises, and simulations that align with the learning objectives and promote active engagement.

- Include opportunities for hands-on practice, group discussions, case studies, role-plays, and other interactive exercises to enhance learning.

- Tailor activities to accommodate different learning styles and preferences, ensuring inclusivity and effectiveness.

- Create visually appealing materials, such as slides, handouts, worksheets, and multimedia resources, that are easy to understand and align with the content of the training program.

- Provide clear instructions and guidance for facilitators on how to effectively utilize the materials during the training workshops, ensuring smooth facilitation and participant engagement.

# Development

## Review and Iterate

- Conduct a thorough review of the developed content and materials by subject matter experts, instructional designers, and necessary stakeholders.

- Gather feedback on clarity, accuracy, relevance, and effectiveness of the content.

- Incorporate suggested revisions and improvements based on the feedback received.

## Finalize Content

- Make final adjustments to the content, materials, and activities 

- Ensure that all components of the training program are polished and ready for implementation.


# Implementation

## Train Facilitators _(if applicable)_

- Provide comprehensive training and support to facilitators who will deliver the training workshops.

- Familiarize facilitators with the content, materials, activities, and instructional techniques.

$$ Deliver Training

- Schedule and conduct the live training workshops according to the established agenda.

    - **Use a Descriptive Event Title**: Clearly state the purpose of the training workshop in the event title.

    - **Include Date and Time**: Specify the date and time of the training workshop, including the start and end times.

    - **Add Location or Online Platform Link**: Provide the physical location if it's an in-person workshop, or include the link to the online platform if it's virtual.

    - **Attach Agenda or Meeting Detail**s: Attach a document or include meeting details in the event description outlining the agenda and topics to be covered during the workshop.

    - **Send Invitations to Relevant Participants**: Invite only those individuals who need to attend the training workshop, ensuring that the invitation list is targeted and relevant.

- Facilitators should set expectations for participation and communicate the importance of providing their full attention. 

- Engage participants, encourage active participation, and create a supportive learning environment.

- Use facilitation techniques to guide discussions, reinforce key concepts, and address learner needs and concerns.


# Evaluation

## Collect Feedback

- Gather feedback promptly from participants following each training session. 

- Utilize surveys, evaluations, or feedback forms to capture participant perceptions, satisfaction levels, and suggestions for improvement.
