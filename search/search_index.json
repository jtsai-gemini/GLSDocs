It was developed by Donald Kirkpatrick in the late 1950s and has since become a standard framework for assessing learning outcomes. The model consists of four levels, each representing a different aspect of evaluation:</p> <p>Level 1: Reaction - This level focuses on participants' immediate reactions to the training program. It involves collecting feedback on aspects such as the training content, delivery, and overall learning experience. This feedback is usually gathered through surveys or questionnaires to gauge participants' satisfaction and engagement.</p> <p>Level 2: Learning - This level examines the extent to which participants have acquired knowledge and skills from the training program. It involves assessing the learning outcomes by conducting pre- and post-tests or other forms of assessments. The goal is to determine whether participants have gained the intended knowledge and skills.</p> <p>Level 3: Behavior - This level assesses the transfer of learning into workplace behaviors. It focuses on whether participants have successfully applied the acquired knowledge and skills in their job roles. Evaluation methods can include observation, self-assessment, supervisor feedback, or other performance indicators.</p> <p>Level 4: Results - This level looks at the broader impact of the training program on organizational goals. It measures the overall effectiveness of the training by examining its impact on key performance indicators (KPIs) or other relevant metrics. This level aims to determine the return on investment (ROI) and the extent to which the training has influenced organizational outcomes.</p> <p>The Kirkpatrick model provides a systematic approach to evaluate learning programs at multiple levels, from participants' reactions to the ultimate impact on organizational performance. It helps organizations assess the effectiveness of their training initiatives and make data-driven decisions for improvement.</p>"},{"location":"L%26D/Developing%20and%20Delivering%20Live%20Training%20Workshops/","title":"Developing and Delivering Live Training Workshops","text":"<p>Last Updated: 05/28/2025</p>"},{"location":"L%26D/Developing%20and%20Delivering%20Live%20Training%20Workshops/#basics","title":"Basics","text":"<p>What is this about?</p> <p>This document provides a standardized process, based on the ADDIE model, for the L\\&amp;D Team to develop and deliver live training workshops.</p> <p>Who is involved?</p> <ul> <li>Learning &amp; Development Team</li> </ul> <p>Where will it happen?</p> <ul> <li>The process can occur in any suitable venue or platform chosen by the L\\&amp;D.</li> </ul> <p>How often should we work on this?</p> <ul> <li>Whenever a new live training workshop needs to be developed and delivered.</li> </ul> <p>How long should it take?</p> <ul> <li>The process should be completed efficiently, with the goal of delivering workshops in a timely manner.
